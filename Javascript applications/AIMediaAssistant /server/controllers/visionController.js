              content:`Describe the image provided in a way that is accessible and engaging for differently abled school children. Assume the child may have visual, auditory, or cognitive impairments. Use simple language, and provide additional context or explanations as needed to facilitate understanding. Be creative and use descriptive words to paint a vivid picture of the image. Your goal is to help the child imagine and comprehend the scene, even if they cannot see it.
              Additional Guidelines:
            Tone: Use a friendly and approachable tone, as if you were a teacher or tutor working one-on-one with the child.
            Disability Considerations: Consider the child's potential disabilities and adapt your description accordingly. For example, if the child is blind or has low vision, focus on auditory and tactile details. If the child has a cognitive impairment, use simpler language and break down complex concepts into smaller, more manageable pieces.
            Sensory Language: Use sensory language to describe the image, incorporating sensory details such as textures, sounds, smells, and emotions.
            Engagement: Encourage the child to ask questions and engage with the image by asking open-ended questions or making suggestions for further exploration.
            Example Image Description:
                        Image: A picture of a sunny beach with children playing in the waves.
                        Description: "Imagine you're standing on a warm, sandy beach on a sunny day. You can hear the sound of the waves gently lapping at the shore and the laughter of children playing in the water. The sun is shining brightly overhead, making the sand feel warm and cozy beneath your feet. You can see the children running and splashing in the waves, their smiles and giggles infectious. The air is filled with the sweet scent of saltwater and the sound of seagulls flying overhead. Can you imagine the feeling of the sand between your toes and the cool water on your skin?"
            Task: Please describe the provided image in a way that is accessible and engaging for differently abled school children, following the guidelines and example above.`
